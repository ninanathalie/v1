          <p className="font-normal text-justify leading-relaxed xl:leading-7 mb-2">
            I recently transitioned to full-time coding and loving every minute of it! I have experience with Shopify Liquid, Javascript, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. I am also currently learning React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p className="font-normal text-justify leading-relaxed xl:leading-7 mb-2">
            Previously, I worked as a Product Designer at Edenred for their B2B Payroll Portal, a FinTech company with a presence in 45 countries. I also worked as a Web Designer at BFL Group, mainly responsible for designing and improving the user experience of Brands For Less
            shoppers. I worked on various projects, from creating experiences for e-marketing opportunities or solving the end-to-end workflow of the Brands for Less' mobile app and many more.
          </p>
          <p className="font-normal text-justify leading-relaxed xl:leading-7 mb-2">
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading articles on Medium, writing on my personal blog, or going to the gym. I also love learning new things, although that often means being in front of my computer once again ^.^
